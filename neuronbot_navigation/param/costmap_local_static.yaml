  update_frequency: 10.0
  publish_frequency: 10.0
  # The "publish_frequency" parameter determines the rate, in Hz,
  # at which the costmap will publish visualization information

  width: 8.0
  height: 8.0
  resolution: 0.025
  # parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap.
  # Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map,
  # but most of the time we tend to set them equally.

  static_map: false
  # If you aren't using an existing map or map server,
  # set the static_map parameter to false.

  rolling_window: true
  # parameter to true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world.
