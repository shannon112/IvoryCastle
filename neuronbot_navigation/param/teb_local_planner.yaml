 # Optimization
 #For each obstacle (point/ occupied costmap cell, line, polygon) the closest pose of the planned trajectory is located (see figure above). According to the value of parameter obstacle_poses_affected neighbors of the closest pose are taken into account as well. Only this selected subset of poses is taken into account in the subsequent optimization step (here 3 poses and therefore 3 penalty terms). The association process is repeated after no_inner_iterations (parameter), resp. within each outer optimization iteration. The value of obstacle_poses_affected slightly influences the smoothness of the trajectory around obstacles. Also bigger obstacles require more connected poses to avoid inadmissable shortcuts. You may also choose a high value (> trajectory length) in order to connect all poses with each obstacle.
